      "set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",

      "\n",
      "Q5: Remove items from the set at once  \n",
      "A5: To remove items from a set at once, you can use the set difference operation. For example, if you have a set `A` and a set `B`, and you want to remove all items in `B` from `A` at once, you can do this by using the set difference operation `A.difference_update(B)`. This will modify set `A` to remove all items in `B` without creating a new set.\n",
